# Basic  Arithmetic Operators in Python

# x = 10
# y = 5

# z = x + y # addition
# a = x - y # subtraction
# b = x * y # multiplication
# c = x / y # division

# print(z, a, b, c)


# String Operations
# str1 = "surya"
# str2 = "prakash"

# str3 = str1 + str2 # concatenation
# str4 = str1 * 3    # repetition
# print(str3)
# print(str4)

# Membership Operators
# line = 'hello world, this is surya, and welcome to my world'

# print('surya' in line)      # True
# print('python' not in line) # True
# print('world' not in line)  # False

# Comparison Operators
# x = 10
# y = 33

# print(x == y) # False
# print(x != y) # True
# print(x > y)  # False
# print(x < y)  # True
# print(x >= y) # False
# print(x <= y) # True

# Numeric Operators

# x = 10
# y = 7

# # Arithmetic Operators
# print(x + y)  # Addition
# print(x - y)  # Subtraction
# print(x * y)  # Multiplication
# print(x / y)  # Division
# print(x % y)  # Modulus
# print(x ** y) # Exponentiation
# print(x // y) # Floor Division

# # Comparison Operators
# print(x == y) # Equal to
# print(x != y) # Not equal to
# print(x > y)  # Greater than
# print(x < y)  # Less than
# print(x >= y) # Greater than or equal to
# print(x <= y) # Less than or equal to
